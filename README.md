# Open Business Agents

**An open ecosystem of specialized AI agents for real business work.**

Discover agents for video, image, and voice production, YouTube growth, SEO, social media, advertising, sales, research, analytics, go-to-market orchestration, and more — powered by real APIs, not just prompts. The same agents can be used directly by businesses or deployed repeatedly by agencies for their clients.

Open Business Agents is a curated directory of AI agents, organized as broad, focused **umbrella repositories** (one per capability area) rather than hundreds of one-off micro-repos. Each umbrella repo bundles several related sub-agents so it's easy to browse, easy to maintain, and actually rankable on GitHub search.

The catalog supports two operating modes: a business can run an agent in its own workspace, or an agency can deploy the same agent across multiple client workspaces with its own processes, approvals, and delivery model.

This project is independent of, but built to work with, the [Muapi API](https://muapi.ai) — a unified API for 500+ generative-media models (video, image, voice, audio, 3D). Agents here reference Muapi's public API surfaces for execution; no Muapi source code or private implementation details live in this catalog.

## Why umbrella repos, not micro-repos

A directory of 100+ single-purpose repos (`email-verification-agent`, `funding-signals-agent`, ...) is hard to browse, duplicates maintenance overhead, and doesn't rank for anything. Instead, each umbrella repo is a broad, high-search-volume category (e.g. "AI video agent," "AI SEO agent") that houses several narrower sub-agents as sections inside itself. A sub-agent is promoted to its own umbrella only once its own search volume and capability set justify it.

A "Blueprint" umbrella means at least one sub-agent inside it is built on a live Muapi API — check that repo's own README for which specific sub-agents are live vs. still Coming Soon.

See [`categories/`](categories/) for a longer description of each grouping, or jump straight into a repo above.

## Status labels

Every agent in this catalog carries one of these labels so you can judge maturity before you build on it:

- **Coming Soon** — instructions are drafted, but the agent depends on a Muapi API capability that isn't live yet.
- **Blueprint** — complete instructions and workflow, backed by live APIs, but not yet verified end-to-end.
- **Tested** — the workflow has been run against the stated APIs.
- **Live** — a public demo or hosted implementation exists.
- **Open Source** — a runnable or independently usable implementation is available.
- **Deprecated** — the API or workflow is no longer supported.

## How an agent repo is structured

Every umbrella repo follows the same shape:

```text
ai-<category>-agent/
├── README.md              # what this category covers, why it's here
├── agents/
│   └── <sub-agent>/
│       └── SKILL.md        # the canonical, runtime-agnostic instruction file
├── examples/
└── LICENSE
```

`SKILL.md` is a Markdown instruction file any LLM runtime — a hosted agent, an MCP client, a custom app — can load directly. No application code is required.

## Using an agent

1. Open the umbrella repo for the category you need.
2. Read the sub-agent's `SKILL.md` for its mission, required inputs, and workflow.
3. Get a Muapi API key at [muapi.ai](https://muapi.ai) if the agent needs live execution (media generation, data lookups, etc.).
4. Load the `SKILL.md` into your agent runtime of choice, or follow it manually.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Short version: propose an agent, follow the template, describe the APIs it needs honestly, and open a PR — either as a new sub-agent inside an existing umbrella repo, or as a link to your own high-quality external repo.
